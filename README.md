## Task Management App

- To run the client side first "yarn" command should be run. After the installation of dependencies to start the application "yarn dev" command should be run.

- The client app is ready with a hosted api url. No need to run the backend separately.

- For testing the backend, first install the dependencies using "yarn" command, then "yarn dev" command is to be run to start the server.

- There are environment variables which needs to be provided for backend. Those are "PORT", "MONGO_URI" and "SECRET_KEY".
